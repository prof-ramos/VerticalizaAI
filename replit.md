## Overview

Verticaliza-AI is a specialized web application designed to automate the analysis and structuring of Brazilian public exam (concurso p√∫blico) announcements. The system extracts content from PDF edital documents and uses Google's Gemini AI to organize the programmatic content into a structured, hierarchical format. Users can upload PDF files, receive AI-processed results, and export the structured content as CSV files or copy it to their clipboard for further use in study planning tools.

## Recent Changes (January 2025)

‚úì **Database Integration**: Successfully migrated from memory storage to PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
‚úì **Complete Backend API**: Implemented full CRUD operations for editals and verticalized content
‚úì **AI Processing Service**: Integrated Google Gemini 2.5-flash for content extraction and structuring
‚úì **PDF Processing**: Added pdf-parse library for extracting text from uploaded PDF files
‚úì **Frontend Components**: Built complete React interface with upload, processing, and results sections
‚úì **File Upload System**: Implemented multer-based file upload with 20MB limit and PDF-only validation
‚úì **Export Features**: Added CSV download and clipboard copy functionality
‚úì **Application Running**: Server successfully running on port 5000 with all services integrated

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
The client-side application is built with **React** and **TypeScript**, using **Vite** as the build tool and development server. The UI leverages **shadcn/ui** components built on top of **Radix UI** primitives with **Tailwind CSS** for styling. State management is handled through **TanStack Query** (React Query) for server state and local React state for UI interactions.

The frontend follows a component-based architecture with four main application states:
- Upload state for file selection and validation
- Processing state with progress indicators
- Results state displaying structured content
- Error state for handling failures

**Key architectural decisions:**
- Single-page application with client-side routing via Wouter
- Component composition pattern using shadcn/ui for consistent design
- Form handling with React Hook Form and Zod validation
- File upload with client-side validation (PDF only, 20MB limit)

### Backend Architecture
The server is built with **Express.js** and **TypeScript**, following a layered architecture pattern:

**API Layer:** RESTful endpoints handling file uploads and processing requests
**Service Layer:** Business logic separation with dedicated services for PDF processing and AI integration
**Data Layer:** PostgreSQL database with Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations

**Key architectural decisions:**
- Multer middleware for handling multipart file uploads with memory storage
- Service-oriented architecture separating concerns (PDF extraction, AI processing, data persistence)
- Error handling middleware with consistent JSON error responses
- Environment-specific configuration management

### Data Storage Solutions
The application uses **PostgreSQL** as the primary database with **Drizzle ORM** providing type-safe database operations. The schema includes three main entities:

**Users table:** For future authentication implementation (currently unused in MVP)
**Editals table:** Stores uploaded PDF metadata and extracted raw text
**VerticalizedContents table:** Stores AI-processed results in JSON format with optional CSV exports

**Key architectural decisions:**
- Relational design with foreign key relationships
- JSON storage for flexible AI response structures
- Separate storage of raw text and processed content for audit trails
- Optional user association for future multi-tenant capabilities

### Authentication and Authorization
Currently implemented as an anonymous system for MVP. The database schema includes user tables for future authentication implementation, but no authentication middleware is currently active.

**Future considerations:**
- JWT-based authentication
- Session management with connect-pg-simple
- Role-based access control for premium features
